        <h1>Pork Nilaga</h1>
        <img src="../img/nilaga.jpg" alt="Pork Nilaga" height="400">
        <p>Pork Nilaga is a type of Filipino pork soup in clear broth. I used pork belly in this version along with other ingredients such as potato, saba banana, and pechay (or baby bok choy). It is a perfect dish that you can enjoy during cold and rainy weather. In this nilaga version, I added Knorr Pork Cube to provide more flavor to the dish.  I suggest that you serve this hot with a small bowl or saucer of fish sauce (with chili pepper if you prefer it  a bit spicy) on the side.</p>
        <p>Pork Nilaga is one of those dishes that I tried to cook when I was starting out. My mom makes this almost regularly on a rainy day. I was able to observe how she does every step. It seemed effortless, so I thought of giving it a try.</p>
